       <div class="text2"> The first emergence of a swallowable electronic device was in 1957, this device used radio frequency to transmit temperature and pressure readings.The field lay stagnant until technology caught up with invention in the 1990s. The first digital pill to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a version of aripiprazole (Abilify) manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, was approved in November 2017.

       <div class="text2"> The whole system is called Abilify MyCite, and consists of the pill, the wearable sensor and a smartphone app. The actual drug is Abilify (generic name aripiprazole), a medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The drug is sold by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, and the sensor in the pill was built by Proteus Digital Health. Though the idea may sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, the technology is based on a principle first outlined more than 200 years ago, said Dr. George Savage, chief medical officer and co-founder of Proteus Digital Health.
