      SpaceX is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company. SpaceX is headquartered in Hawthorne, California, United States. SpaceX was founded 18 years ago, on May 6, 2002 by billionare Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars.
      <br>
      <br>
      Elon Musk holds 54% of SpaceX's equity with 78% controlled by voting control. As of 2020, SpaceX has 8000 employees and is worth more than $33.3 billion.

      SpaceX’s family of Falcon launch vehicles are the first and only orbital class rockets capable of reflight. Depending on the performance required for the mission, Falcon lands on one of our autonomous spaceport droneships out on the ocean or one of our landing zones near our launch pads. Several years ago, SpaceX was going to open up the smallsat launch market with the Falcon 1, which originally was to launch about 600 kilograms to LEO for $6 million; the payload capacity later declined to about 420 kilograms as the price increased to around $9 million. Later, the Falcon 1e was to provide approximately 1,000 kilograms for $11 million, but the company withdrew the vehicle from the market, citing limited demand.

Dragon was launched into orbit by SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle to resupply the International Space Station. On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully redezvous with and attach to the ISS.

      On 23 December 2008, NASA awarded a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract to SpaceX, with contract options that could potentially increase the maximum contract value to $3.1 billion.[28] The contract called for 12 flights, with an overall minimum of 20,000 kg (44,000 lb) of cargo to be carried to the ISS.

      In 2014, SpaceX released the total combined development costs for both the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and the Dragon capsule. NASA provided US$396 million while SpaceX provided over US$450 million to fund both development efforts.

      Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle powered by Merlin engines, burning cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. Its name is derived from the fictional Star Wars spacecraft, the Millennium Falcon. Falcon 9 became the first orbital rocket to achieve propulsive landing.

      Falcon 9 is the world’s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access. Falcon 9 has a total of 85 launches, 46 landings, and 32 reflown rockets. Since May 2016, the standard price for a Falcon 9 Full Thrust mission (allowing booster recovery) is published as $62 million.

      SpaceX have proposed the development of Mars transportation infrastructure in order to facilitate the eventual colonization of Mars. The mission architecture includes fully reusable launch vehicles, human-rated spacecraft, on-orbit propellant tankers, rapid-turnaround launch/landing mounts, and local production of rocket fuel on Mars via in situ resource utilisation (ISRU). Musk plans to send a SpaceX rocket to Mars with cargo only, by 2022. A second mission, which would take more cargo and crew is targeted for 2024. Musk states that he'll send a million people to Mars by 2050.

      Organizations have proposed plans for a human mission to Mars, the first step towards any colonization effort, but no person has set foot on the planet. However, landers and rovers have successfully explored the planetary surface and delivered information about conditions on the ground. Reasons for colonizing Mars include pure curiosity, the potential for humans to provide more in-depth observational research than unmanned rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the possibility that the settlement of other planets could decrease the likelihood of human extinction.
